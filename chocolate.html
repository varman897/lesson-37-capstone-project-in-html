           <p> Hi, my name is Varman and today I'm going to talk about chocolate</p>
           <p>
            People like chocolate because of many reasons and today I'm going to be talking
            about them. As you might already know chocolate is loved for it's sweet taste. I also 
            like chocolate for that reason. If you didn't know chocolate comes from cocoa beans. They
            melt them and they add sugar.
           </p>
           <br>
           <h2>Here are some ingredients!</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>cocoa solids</li>
            <li>cocoa butter</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>lecithin</li>
            <li>flavoring</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>Process</h3>
           <p>
            To make chocolate people have to find a cocoa tree,
            take a bud of and rip the beans out. Next the beans are 
            taken to a factory to be layed in the sun and the flipped over
            . Then finally they are tooken inside melted and mixed with sugar.
            Lastly they are frozen and packaged to be sent to you.

           <h5>They are many chocolate factory's in America and around the whole world.</h5><br>
           <p>Usually most chocolate factory's have thousands of workers.</p><br>
           <p>I've never been to one but I have saw video's of them and they look cool.</p><br>
           <p>Some of them even have golden tickets that you can win to spent the day there.</p>
           
           
           <p>Even though chocolate is tasty it is unhealthy and I do not recommend eating a lot.
            Also when you eat a lot you start to feel sick which makes you tired. Also research shows
            that if you eat too much chocolate your brain becomes less sharp. So it's best you don't 
            eat to much chocolate.
