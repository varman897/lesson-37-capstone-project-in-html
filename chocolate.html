           <p> Hi, my name is Varman and today I'm going to talk about chocolate</p>
           <p>
            People like chocolate because of many reasons and today I'm going to be talking
            about them. As you might already know chocolate is loved for it's sweet taste. I also 
            like chocolate for that reason. If you didn't know chocolate comes from cocoa beans. They
            melt them and they add sugar.
           </p>
           <br>
           <h2>Here are some ingredients!</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>cocoa solids</li>
            <li>cocoa butter</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>lecithin</li>
            <li>flavoring</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>Process</h3>
           <p>
            To make chocolate people have to find a cocoa tree,
            take a bud of and rip the beans out. Next the beans are 
            taken to a factory to be layed in the sun and the flipped over
            . Then finally they are tooken inside melted and mixed with sugar.
            Lastly they are frozen and packaged to be sent to you.
           </p>
  
           <h2>Here's an image of a chocolate factory</h2>
           <br>
           <img src="factory.jpg" alt="plants" height="400" width="400">
           <h5>They are many chocolate factory's in America and around the whole world.</h5><br>
           <p>Usually most chocolate factory's have thousands of workers.</p><br>
           <p>I've never been to one but I have saw video's of them and they look cool.</p><br>
           <p>Some of them even have golden tickets that you can win to spent the day there.</p>
           
           
           <p>Even though chocolate is tasty it is unhealthy and I do not recommend eating a lot.
            Also when you eat a lot you start to feel sick which makes you tired. Also research shows
            that if you eat too much chocolate your brain becomes less sharp. So 
           </p>
